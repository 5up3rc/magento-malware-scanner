# Scan your site in 30 seconds

On a standard Linux or Mac OSX server, run two commands to find infected files:

```bash
wget git.io/mwscan.txt
grep -Erlf all-confirmed.txt /var/www
```

It will show you, for example:
```
/var/www/skin/cc.php
/var/www/errors/backdoor.php
/var/www/app/Mage.php
```

You should examine these files, and delete or restore them from a clean backup. 

For more features, such as incremental scanning (only new files), periodic scanning, whitelisting and extension filtering, see the [advanced usage page](docs/usage.md).

# Objective

For the free [MageReport](https://www.magereport.com) we already analyse lots of malware samples. Now, many system administrators are doing the same work. That's incredibly inefficient. Goal:

> Once a particular strain of malware has been found and analyzed, nobody should have to duplicate these efforts.

This repository is a community effort of security conscious people. [Contributions most welcome!](CONTRIBUTING.md)

# Test coverage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gwillem/magento-malware-scanner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gwillem/magento-malware-scanner)

Travis-CI verifies:

- that all samples are detected 
- all signatures match at least one sample
- Magento releases do not trigger false positives
